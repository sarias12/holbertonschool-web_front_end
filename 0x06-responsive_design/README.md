## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:
* Mobile-first design
* Media-queries
* Sizes to use for responsive web design
* How to make a website responsive
* The differences between responsive and adaptive design
* CSS units that are used to make elements flexible

### [0. Fix the hero banner](./01-styles.css)
* Hero banner background is visible


### [1. Make the container flexible](./02-styles.css)
* Update the .container selector by changing width to max-width. If you resize your browser, you should see that the content is resizing.


### [2. Fix layout issues](./02-1-styles.css)
* You should now be able to easily view the website on a device of any screen/window size.


### [3. Generate images with responsive breakpoints](./03-styles.css)


### [4. Create the mobile icon and hide the menu](./04-styles.css)
* We want to have a clickable icon that shows and hide our navigation. We don’t want to use JavaScript but find a pure HTML / CSS way. We learned that input type checkbox have a checked - unchecked state. So we are going to use this for our menu.


### [5. Hamburger!](./05-styles.css)
* Let’s now, use a little bit of CSS magic to create an “hamburger” icon just with CSS.


### [6. Add the behavior based on menu-btn state](./06-styles.css)


### [7. Make the font size responsive](./07-styles.css)
* We have multiple ways to make the typography responsive. The basic way would be to create multiple media queries and set a different font-size. But because we are using REM that are based on 62.5% (defined in the html selector). Changing that value would change proportionally all font sizes.


### [8. Improve the "Works" section](./08-styles.css)


### [9. Improve the "Footer" section](./09-styles.css)


### [10. Fix the top header background](./10-styles.css)



### [11. Make the article page responsive](./100-styles.css)
